# Frontend Mentor - manage-landing-page

frontend mentor manage landing page challenge

This is my solution to the [Manage landing page Challenge on Frontend Mentor].

- Note:there are so many ways to complete this challenge, so this is my own way of completing the challenge.

# Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
